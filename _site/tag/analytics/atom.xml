<p>With this site refresh, I decided I was going to do something that, for the most part, I avoided on my last site incarnation. I’ve installed a battery of statistical gathering tools on my site to see how users are using the various globs of data. It has become eye-opening to me just how much data you actually can gather now-a-days. Some of the tools I have configured on Realjenius.com:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> - Thorough statistics regarding site usage and benchmarking against public sites Tracks nationality, IP, user agents, click-throughs, and more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> - Tracks the usage of your site’s RSS feeds, and click-throughs on those feeds.</li>
  <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">Wordpress-Stats</a> - Tracks statistics centric to your wordpress installation. This is particularly valuable for seeing the content on the site in relation to each other (which particular articles are more popular).</li>
  <li><a href="http://bit.ly/">Bit.Ly</a> - Shortened URLs for social sites that track received clicks. One of the things I’ve started to like about this is the track-backs it provides to the actual conversations that mention the link.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/index2.html">Google Webmaster Tools</a> - Tracks search rankings for your site. Probably the most narrow-focused of the tools on this list, but the only one that actually gives insight into the actual GoogleBot indexing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s fascinating about all of this is that none of these tools provide a complete picture. Admittedly, Google Analytics gets the closest, however it’s information is high-level enough that the aggregation can hide some fascinating details. Great for overall statistics, however.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tools like Bit.Ly and FeedBurner let you see the usage of and navigation to your content outside the normal purview of your site.</p>

<p>Overall, the point is that the value of a particular statistic is all about perspective. Different tools see different things, so it’s all about the slice of metrics you’re looking at, and how you are looking at it.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of the rewrite, I did finally decided to invest in configuring sitemap tools so that Realjenius.com <a href="http://www.realjenius.com/sitemap.xml">would have a sitemap.xml</a>. It’s been interesting to see the influence it had on how Google in particular indexed my site - not sure if it’s made a positive difference yet or not - I don’t have enough new unique content under the sitemap to be sure.</p>

<p>Time will certainly tell.</p>
