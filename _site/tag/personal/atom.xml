  <description><![CDATA[
     <p>Today, Media Temple announced that they are being acquired by GoDaddy.</p>

<p>Here’s a tip for Media Temple: if you have to spend your entire FAQ trying to convince folks that the acquisition isn’t a bad idea… maybe <strong>it actually is a bad idea.</strong></p>

<p>But surely, that’s not enough reason to switch hosts. It seems silly to move, just because of an acquisition that Media Temple has said so strongly <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/2013/10/15/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition/">won’t affect their service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="what-about-godaddys-reputation-in-the-tech-community">What about GoDaddy’s reputation in the tech community?</h4>
  <p>GoDaddy has been transformed in recent months and is essentially a new company. If we did not like what we have seen, we would not have joined the GoDaddy family. They have overhauled their leadership team and attracted tech talent from the best-of-the-best. We love “the new GoDaddy” that CEO Blake Irving and his team have created, especially their new approach with advertising, product focus and UX.</p>

  <p>Though neither GoDaddy’s brand nor operations are being integrated into ours, we are excited to be a positive influence on them with how to make even more improvements to better serve the Web pro community.</p>

  <h4 id="will-media-temple-be-merging-with-godaddy">Will Media Temple be merging with GoDaddy?</h4>
  <p>No, we keep operating independently. The strategy to keep the two companies operating independently was critical for us. While we are excited about GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving’s vision to build bridges between GoDaddy and the Web developer community, the commitment to maintain (mt)’s independent operations is what sealed the deal for us.</p>

  <h4 id="how-does-this-affect-me-as-an-mt-customer">How does this affect me, as an (mt) customer?</h4>
  <p>It doesn’t. (mt) and GoDaddy continue to operate independently, so it’s ‘business as usual.’ We’ll keep doing what we do best: serving you and helping you succeed online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me believing any of these answers is predicated by me “trusting” the author; my web-host. While I have implicitly trusted the intentions of Media Temple over the years I have used their service, I have absolutely no trust for Go Daddy. And the reason is simple: They have shown time and again to have no integrity.</p>

<p>Integrity is a key element in your relationship with your web-host, as you are giving them a lot of trust in the execution and support of your personal and business ventures. Sebastiaan de With has summarized perfectly how GoDaddy has shown they don’t have the type of integrity I’m interested in my host having:</p>

<div>
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>“<a href="https://twitter.com/Scobleizer">@Scobleizer</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/sdw">@sdw</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mediatemple">@mediatemple</a> why switch? What are you looking for that you don&#39;t currently have?”&#10;&#10;Integrity. <a href="http://t.co/DEL6nu9rK8">pic.twitter.com/DEL6nu9rK8</a></p>&mdash; Sebastiaan de With (@sdw) <a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/statuses/390172367856496640">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
	<script async="" src="http://panke.me//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

<p>And so, with that, I must choose to vote with the only voice I have: my business. Which means I’m looking at the alternative hosts for the first time in many years. I currently run “unmanaged” VPS-style hosting via a DV-Developer at Media Temple, so my interests are specifically in finding a competitive and well-respected alternative in that space. If you are a Grid-Service or DV-Managed user; this list may not be useful for you.</p>

<p>For my analysis, I’m explicitly targeting the “$50/month” price point in unmanaged servers (tier 2 at MT). Let’s enumerate what I get at Media Temple for that price:</p>

<ul>
  <li>16 cores; un-documented “fast-enough” CPU speeds.</li>
  <li>2 GB of memory.</li>
  <li>40 GB of RAID-10 storage.</li>
  <li>650 GB bandwidth.</li>
  <li>Root + SSH access.</li>
  <li>Old but current-enough OpenVZ kernel capable of running Ubuntu 13.04.</li>
  <li>Parallels power panel</li>
  <li>Good top-level tools for re-provisioning, restoring in emergencies, upgrading on-the-spot, and managing DNS.</li>
  <li>Basic real-time server statistics</li>
  <li>Good tech support</li>
  <li>No built-in backups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let’s look at some competition (in no particular order)!</p>

</table>

<p>Here are options I explicitly excluded for one reason or another:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EC2 and GCE - Biggest issue here is the commodity disks and the weird ephemeral IP nonsense. I’ve done a lot of hosting with EC2 through my previous life, and have no interest in bringing that into my personal world.</li>
  <li>Heroku - I’m actually a big fan of Heroku, but only if I had a desire to scale out, which I don’t. I’d rather have one efficient-as-possible VPS, as opposed to the Heroku sandbox. I also need root access.</li>
  <li>HostGator - Hello 1998. No thank you.</li>
  <li>SoftLayer - SoftLayer has a lot of good enterprise-level hosting offerings (and their dedicated is way cheaper than cloud in many cases), but it’s just not priced well for where I’m coming in. Feels targeted to bigger fish than I.</li>
  <li>DreamHost - I had nothing but bad experiences with the snarky, always ironic DreamHost “support”. I have no interest to go back and feel like I’m in a hipster coffee shop all day.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Right now I’m exploring hosts in this option:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Digital Ocean - This looks really compelling at the moment. Pricing is great; tools look great, and they have a good reputation right now.</li>
  <li>Linode - Some folks simply swear by Linode, and I like some of their features such as HA proxy options. Pricing is good.</li>
  <li>A Small Orange - These folks have a lot of street cred, and while their pricing isn’t totally competitive everywhere, their deployment looks pretty sharp all told.</li>
</ol>

<p>So did I miss anybody you’d suggest?</p>

  <title>DV Developer Acquired</title>
  <link>http://panke.me/journal/2013/10/01/dv-developer-install.html</link>
  <author>R.J. Lorimer</author>
  <pubDate>2013-10-01T00:00:00+08:00</pubDate>
  <guid>http://panke.me/journal/2013/10/01/dv-developer-install.html</guid>
  <description><![CDATA[
     <p>As I discussed earlier this year, , improving their underlying virtualization software, getting a more recent kernel, and otherwise polishing up the various bits. After slogging through the last couple months of my second child being born, I finally got my head above water and pulled the trigger on migrating to a new installation. I was on an old (ve), so I chose to go to a <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/vps/developer/">DV Developer</a>, Level 2.</p>

<p>Since both the (ve) and the DV Developer are a raw, bare-bones Linux installation, there isn’t a ton to report in terms of pretty oohs and ahhs, and the provisioning and migration occurred entirely without incident (as it should be), so I can’t prattle on about that arduous process, since it was pretty much a single button press followed by “ssh #######” 5 minutes later.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I can show a few interesting tidbits for those that are interested.</p>

<h2 id="as-advertised-boxi-ness">As Advertised Boxi-ness</h2>

<p>The Level 2 is “2GB Memory, 40GB Storage, and 650GB Bandwidth”. One thing I’ve always appreciated about Media Temple is the number of cores they allow you to run on for your slice of the computing pie:</p>

<div class="imgblock">
<div class="noalignouter">
	<div class="noaligninner">

<div class="img thumbnail alignnone">
	<img src="http://panke.me/images/articles/misc/dv_stats.png" />
	
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

<p>Other VPS offerings in the world seem to generally offer more like 2 or 4 cores, as opposed to the 16 made available on Media Temple. Even if the aggregate compute power available through MT is no better than other hosts, I prefer it being split across cores like this when hosting concurrent web apps.</p>

<p>You can also see that I do in fact have 2GB of memory at my fingertips; no trickery there. I should also note that the disks are SAS, and the ethernet is gigabit - so you have very few bottlenecks baked in (as you might with something like EC2).</p>

<h2 id="newer-kernel-newer-virtualization-platform">Newer Kernel; Newer Virtualization Platform</h2>

<p>I lamented rather furiously about the state of the kernel on my (ve) - it was a rather ancient <code>2.6.18</code> build for OpenVZ from Parallels. Their new platform is a more recent, but not what I’d consider super modern <code>2.6.32</code>. It’s certainly new-enough for most needs. The new virtualization platform is also supposed to be more readily upgradable on their part, so hopefully it won’t fall behind quite so badly.</p>

<p>Concretely speaking, I’m currently able to run Ubuntu Server 13.04 without issue, which is a significant step forward from the 10.04 dead-end I previously encountered.</p>

<p>Media Temple also promises significant performance increases for the same resource utilization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DV Developer, formerly known as (ve), streamlines the DV platform for speed, performance and efficiency. Packed with the same upgrades as DV Managed – 25% increase in LAMP performance, 10X increases in backups and maintenance, and industry leading software packages including Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian – DV Developer also provides rebootless updates - upgrade kernel and reboot without downtime, improved stats using vSwap, and unlimited scalability by removing the previous 20 service limit per account. DV Developer customers will also benefit from the new (mt) Media Temple 20/20 Uptime Guarantee. Pricing for DV Developer, including all upgrades, remains the same starting at $30 per month with no commitments required.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="consoles-admins-apis-etc">Consoles, Admins, APIs, Etc.</h2>

<p>None of this is particularly new (in fact, it’s effectively identical to the (ve)), but there are a number of good administrative features available:</p>

<h3 id="admin-and-stats-panel">Admin and Stats Panel</h3>

<p>MediaTemple has an a bevy of administration GUIs, and also has a stats panel that shows sliding history of box performance:</p>

<div class="imgblock">
<div class="noalignouter">
	<div class="noaligninner">

<div class="img thumbnail alignnone">
	<img src="http://panke.me/images/articles/misc/dv_admin_gui.png" />
	
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

<h3 id="power-panel">Power Panel</h3>

<p>You also get a Plesk Parallels Power Panel (Pay Phat Pive Pimes Past), which allows you to perform a number of tasks from a GUI console instead of SSH-ing in:</p>

<div class="imgblock">
<div class="noalignouter">
	<div class="noaligninner">

<div class="img thumbnail alignnone">
	<img src="http://panke.me/images/articles/misc/dv_power_panel.png" />
	
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

<h3 id="apis">APIs</h3>

<p>If you have need to automate your backends, you can with the <a href="http://mediatemple.net/api/">Media Temple ProDev API</a>. This allows you to do many of the things you’d expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add services (instances)</li>
  <li>Get current service information</li>
  <li>Reboot services</li>
  <li>Get service statistics, warnings, thresholds</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Overall I’m quite happy with the new DV Developer. It’s a much needed upgrade, and it has allowed me to modernize my stack across the board without having to work around any particular issues. While performance seems quite good, I had never really felt any reason to complain there, so I can’t speak about the marketed improvements; yet it wouldn’t surprise me given the advancements made (even just in kernels alone).</p>

  <title>RealJenius.com - Now With Less PHP</title>

  <description><![CDATA[
     <p>I have long time been a proponent of WordPress for a quick and painless blogging platform. For years I toiled to create 
a favorable personal blogging platform; re-inventing it time and again in some variant of Java technologies, and constantly being fed up. Despite being a good learning experience, my custom blog was always a thorough pain in my ass to maintain.
That’s what made Drupal, and later WordPress, so appealing. I was able to focus on what I wanted to do, which was deliver    content, without having to futz with my rushed and unfinished web forms. I knew that my site software was going to be
maintained and regularly audited by community reports with respect to security, etc. Unfortunately, despite the flexibility
and plugin architecture, WordPress carries a certain degree of cruft with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PHP is surprisingly hard to host scalably and efficiently.</li>
  <li>WordPress needs a rack of plugins installed to be even remotely performant - most of it gross caching schemes.</li>
  <li>I rather despise maintaining relational database installations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve never been a fan of PHP in any shape or form, so I think it says a lot about how burnt out I had become on trying to 
build a one-man CMS, that I was using WP, and singing its praises.</p>

<p>A post over at <a href="http://nesbot.com">Nesbot.com</a> inspired me to revisit my embargo on personal blog coding, as Brian Nesbitt <a href="http://nesbot.com/2011/11/22/now-running-on-play-2-beta">detailed how he migrated his blog 
with Play 2.0</a>. What struck me in particular was, not so much that he was using <a href="http://www.playframework.org">Play!</a>,
nor that he was now using the shiny 2.0 beta, but that he had built his site without any complex data-store on the back-end.</p>

<p>Suddenly: lightbulb! This triggered me to explore the ideas he so graciously shared with his public site code on github:
<a href="https://github.com/briannesbitt/nesbot.com">https://github.com/briannesbitt/nesbot.com</a>. Of particular note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>His blog entries are simply Play! UI templates.</li>
  <li>The entire blog-entry history is loaded in memory at startup, and cross-indexed for the various navigation.</li>
  <li>The comment system is provided by <a href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a>.</li>
  <li>Blog entries are committed to GitHub, and ostensibly pulled to his server where he then simply restarts the 
server to load the new article.</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t spend much time actually digesting his code, but I appreciate that he posted his approach online, as it
immediately got my gears turning. While I’m not quite ready to share the source of my site (more on this in a moment),
I will share some details on the approach I’ve taken:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each of my blog posts is a template file, and has a “meta” comment on the top. This defines things like the
title, a short summary, the publish date, tags (comma-separated), the category (journal or article),
and optionally some additional compatibility bits, like a legacy id (see below). The comment is YAML formatted
so I have some leniency as I’m authoring, and good error reporting if I get the formatting wrong.</li>
  <li>The file name represents the blog “slug”.</li>
  <li>On startup, I spin through the entire post directory recursively, reading the header comments one-by-one, and
tossing them into a series of in-memory indexes for traversal. The collections are sorted in date descending order,
as that’s the most generally useful ordering for the site.</li>
  <li>The re-load process can also be triggered by an administrative call through the HTTP interface. The reload is completely free of locks via some judicious use of atomic references.</li>
  <li>I’m also using <a href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a> for my comment system, like Brian. Importing from my
existing wordpress site was, for the most part painless. I simply installed the Disqus plugin into my WP install,
and did an export. The hardest part was supporting legacy identifiers. Turns out the IDs that
it uses are: <code>[wpid] http://[site-address]?p=[wpid]</code> - this is where the legacy ID entry comes in to play above.</li>
  <li>I have a private git repo on my server, and every time I write an article, I simply push to the git repo. The server then pulls from the git repo, and I run the administrative reload.</li>
  <li>I’m using <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> for code highlighting. The highlighters that are declared in the post are loaded in “on-demand”, so the included JS is kept to a minimum.</li>
  <li>I have a few custom Play! tags to make writing blogs easier - they do things like reverse routes to other blog posts into anchor tags, create captioned image markup, and dynamically generate series blocks (as seen in my <a href="http://panke.me/tags/distilling-jruby">Distilling JRuby</a> series).</li>
  <li>I’m using a Play profile ID on my server, and %prod. prefixes to support dev and prod properties concurrently
in the same file.</li>
  <li>I’m using a variant of <a href="http://www.playframework.org/community/snippets/17">This Ubuntu up-start script</a> to bootstrap my Play! Framework runtime.</li>
  <li>Thanks to the expressiveness of the the Play routes system, I was able to effectively model my URLs without any
change in pathing to match the existing WordPress site. There are some exceptions, but they are only places where I
felt a change was for the best.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have immediately noticed a complete lack of latency on page loads, which I find quite refreshing. Occasionally one of the Javascript chunks blocks the page-load a bit (whether it be Google Analytics, Disqus, the syntax highlighter, or the Twitter widget, I can’t say). I am keeping my eye out for this, and hopefully will figure it out with Firebug, and I can squash it. Overall, this has been a minimalist’s dream as compared to something chunky like WP.</p>

<p>Before I globally share the blog code, I really wanted to get a few things tidied up (call me vain):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right now the administrative reload is a bit of a shim. I’d really like this to be an automated “on-git-update” event, 
so my involvement is simply a matter of avoiding malformed posting, and pushing the content.</li>
  <li>My error handling is pretty weak-sauce right now - I was slapping this together pretty quickly; the majority of my 
time was in converting my blog entries (which I did by hand, like an idiot).</li>
  <li>Right now I’m using Play 1.2.4 - I want to move to 2.0, but unlike Brian, I plan to wait until it’s final before 
converting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I get through those hurdles, I’ll throw out a follow-up, and hopefully some public mirrors so folks can get some
value (however small) out of my derivative journey. If you have any questions in the mean-time, <a href="http://panke.me/contact">send me a note</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>So Monday is my birthday: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_15">March 15th</a>. For years I remember two things about the way adults reacted to me as a child: (1) Oh, your name is R.J.! That’s just like Dallas! (and for the record, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_(TV_series)">no, no it is not</a> ). Or (2) Oh my! You were born on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March">Ides of March</a>!</p>

<p>It’s funny, because when I was a kid, I had no idea what the ides of march was; I just knew it carried with it a certain degree of playful dread, given the reaction of adults. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned a lot more about what the day actually is, and not what people seem to attribute to it.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I’m talking about, I’m not surprised. It seems like the superstition around the date has faded in recent years. Historically speaking, the term ‘ides’ meant the middle of the month for either Martius (March), Maius (May), Quintillis (July), or October on the Roman calendar. On the Ides of March, the Romans actively celebrated for Mars, the god of war (who, by the way, is awesome).</p>

<p>But the reason that we don’t go around talking about the ides of October is not because the God of the Month was less impressive, but simply because of the historical significance of 3/15. Julius Caesar (a rather important Roman) was murdered by the Brutus’, Longinus, and a bunch of other political turds.</p>

<p>So over the years, the day has carried a negative connotation. It has Dark Ominous Tones.</p>

<p>Now, the truth is, I am no Julius Caesar. Additionally, I find it highly unlikely that anyone will stab me to death. However, I’ve had enough people come up and chatter at me about the ides doom and gloom that I can think of a few to poke with the pointy end of a stick, at least threateningly.</p>

<p>Incidentally - you’ll likely notice that Quintillis is the only month that doesn’t have any aural relationship to it’s English counterpart. Well, it turns out that one of Julius Caesar’s many faults (for which he got the stabby stabby) was reforming the national calendar. The Roman calendar became the Julian calendar as he worked to resolve the listing that occurred in the traditional model set up by Romulus, which had 304 days, and was then later refined by Numa (Numa) which had 355 days. The Julian calendar is identical to our modern Gregorian calendar in terms of length and usage of leap years, but was simply not shifted to match the same days of the year.</p>

<p>When Julius Caesar was murdered, they renamed Quintillis to Julius, and then bippity-boppity-bacon you have July.</p>

<p>So anyway, that’s how I began to call myself the Roman god of war. Don’t make me smite you.</p>

  <title>Site Analytics</title>
  <link>http://panke.me/journal/2009/09/16/site-analytics.html</link>

  <description><![CDATA[
     
<div class="img thumbnail pull-right">

</div>

<p>With this site refresh, I decided I was going to do something that, for the most part, I avoided on my last site incarnation. I’ve installed a battery of statistical gathering tools on my site to see how users are using the various globs of data. It has become eye-opening to me just how much data you actually can gather now-a-days. Some of the tools I have configured on Realjenius.com:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> - Thorough statistics regarding site usage and benchmarking against public sites Tracks nationality, IP, user agents, click-throughs, and more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> - Tracks the usage of your site’s RSS feeds, and click-throughs on those feeds.</li>
  <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">Wordpress-Stats</a> - Tracks statistics centric to your wordpress installation. This is particularly valuable for seeing the content on the site in relation to each other (which particular articles are more popular).</li>
  <li><a href="http://bit.ly/">Bit.Ly</a> - Shortened URLs for social sites that track received clicks. One of the things I’ve started to like about this is the track-backs it provides to the actual conversations that mention the link.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/index2.html">Google Webmaster Tools</a> - Tracks search rankings for your site. Probably the most narrow-focused of the tools on this list, but the only one that actually gives insight into the actual GoogleBot indexing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s fascinating about all of this is that none of these tools provide a complete picture. Admittedly, Google Analytics gets the closest, however it’s information is high-level enough that the aggregation can hide some fascinating details. Great for overall statistics, however.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tools like Bit.Ly and FeedBurner let you see the usage of and navigation to your content outside the normal purview of your site.</p>

<p>Overall, the point is that the value of a particular statistic is all about perspective. Different tools see different things, so it’s all about the slice of metrics you’re looking at, and how you are looking at it.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of the rewrite, I did finally decided to invest in configuring sitemap tools so that Realjenius.com <a href="http://www.realjenius.com/sitemap.xml">would have a sitemap.xml</a>. It’s been interesting to see the influence it had on how Google in particular indexed my site - not sure if it’s made a positive difference yet or not - I don’t have enough new unique content under the sitemap to be sure.</p>

<p>Time will certainly tell.</p>

<p>Oh no! Change!</p>

<p>That’s right, kiddies. I’ve uprooted all that was Realjenius.com once again. This new version includes a major UI refresh (obviously), as well as a significant shift on the underlying platform.</p>

<p>I intentionally avoided migrating content this time through - I’m ready for a fresh start, and eventually I’d like to drop archive.realjenius.com like a bad habit. For now, I’ll be tracking Google Analytics to help make that decision; for better or worse some of the stuff floating around over there is still rather popular in google searches.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more on what I changed, why I changed it, and how I’m liking the new changes. Oh, and if you have no idea who I am or what I’m talking about, be sure to read my <a href="http://panke.me/about.html">about page</a>.</p>
