There is a new "[Between Two Ferns](http://www.funnyordie.com/between_two_ferns)" with [Zach Galifianakis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302108/) over at
[FunnyOrDie.com](http://funnyordie.com) - this time with [Charlize Theron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/). With most of the previous 'Two Fern' interview series, Zach does a remarkable job of combining an awkward, crass, and clueless approach to (supposedly) piss off his interviewee, and typically in short order. Prior interviewees include: Michael Cera, Jimmy Kimmel, Jon Hamm, Bradley Cooper, and Natalie Portman.

In this interview, the tables seem a bit turned; his approach has a different effect.

Never has an advertisement for [Need for Speed: Shift](http://www.shift.needforspeed.com/us) been so convincing.

While this one certainly has some good parts, my personal favorite is still the [Natalie Portman](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/5ef1adb57b/between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis?rel=user&amp;rel_pos=2) interview.
