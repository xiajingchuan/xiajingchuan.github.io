Today, Valve released the [Steam for Linux beta client](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2411827,00.asp) ([more](http://www.zdnet.com/big-time-gaming-coming-to-linux-7000006997/), [and more](http://www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2012/11/6/valve-moves-to-change-pc-gaming-steam-goes-linux.aspx)) to 1000 lucky testers. It's an exciting official event (I [discussed this previously]({% post_url 2012-11-02-valve-steam-uds %})), and while the [supported game list is still quite small](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?snr=1_4_4__12&term=linux#os=linux&advanced=0&sort_order=ASC&page=1), there is no surprise that nearly all of the humble indie bundle games that went to Linux are also available on Steam.

On another note, while there is a certain bit of "layman" reporting in this, I thought this was a surprising report from the Register on [Nvidia releasing 'double-speed' drivers](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/06/nvidia_heralds_steam_for_linux/). [Engadget has a more technical](http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/06/nvidia-valve-geforce-linux-drivers-r310/) walkthrough as well.

It was only a couple of months ago that [Linus gave Nvidia the finger](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/06/torvalds-nvidia-linux/), and there is good reason for that - so as an Nvidia card owner, I'm glad to see that Valve has encouraged to consume a large in-flow of patches and contributions to help them make their Linux offering less horrible.

In reality, the drivers they are releasing only fix performance for a few cards and likely for specific problems found from the Source engine, but even still, a little traction can go a long way. There have been a lot of announcements of potential Linux support recently between Valve, [Unity3d for Linux (which is used aggressively in the indie space)](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2012/07/03/linux-publishing-preview-what-how-and-wherefore-3/), [Star Citizen by Chris Roberts (ala Wing Commander)](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Space-Sim-Star-Citizen-Is-Getting-Closer-to-a-Linux-Release-304249.shtml), and of course [Humble Indie Bundle](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/humble-indie-bundle-6-arrives-with-6-linux-games-in-tow), things are starting to finally look up for Linux gamers!

In closing, here is Linus giving his sign language to Nvidia:
