I just did a pretty big refresh of my site on the backend. The only change that should impact folks directly is that the feed URLs changed:

* `/feed` is now `/atom.xml`
* `/category/[...]/feed` is now `/category/[...]/atom.xml`
* `/tag/[...]/feed` is now `/tag/[...]/atom.xml`

I've put in some 301s for those URLs, so hopefully feeds will automatically update for you.

If you have any issues with the site (links that don't work, etc) please [let me know](/contact.html)!
