Oh no! Change!

That's right, kiddies. I've uprooted all that was Realjenius.com once again. This new version includes a major UI refresh (obviously), as well as a significant shift on the underlying platform.

I intentionally avoided migrating content this time through - I'm ready for a fresh start, and eventually I'd like to drop archive.realjenius.com like a bad habit. For now, I'll be tracking Google Analytics to help make that decision; for better or worse some of the stuff floating around over there is still rather popular in google searches.

Stay tuned for more on what I changed, why I changed it, and how I'm liking the new changes. Oh, and if you have no idea who I am or what I'm talking about, be sure to read my [about page](/about.html).
